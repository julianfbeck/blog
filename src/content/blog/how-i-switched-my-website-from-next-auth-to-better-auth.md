# How I Switched My Website From Next-Auth to Better-Auth

Authentication is a critical component of modern web applications, and choosing the right authentication solution can significantly impact both the developer experience and user experience. In this post, I'll share my journey of migrating from Next-Auth to Better-Auth, outlining the reasons for the switch, the migration process, and the benefits I've experienced.

## Why I Decided to Switch

Next-Auth has been a popular choice for authentication in Next.js applications, but I encountered several limitations that led me to explore alternatives:

- **Customization challenges**: As my application grew, I needed more flexibility with authentication flows that Next-Auth couldn't easily provide
- **Performance concerns**: I noticed authentication was adding overhead to my application
- **Integration issues**: Some third-party services required custom implementation work

## What is Better-Auth?

Better-Auth is a modern authentication solution designed to address many of the limitations of existing auth libraries. It offers:

- More customizable authentication flows
- Improved performance metrics
- Simplified integration with various providers
- Better TypeScript support
- Enhanced security features

## The Migration Process

### 1. Preparation and Planning

Before making any changes, I took time to:

- Document existing auth flows
- Identify potential breaking changes
- Create a rollback plan
- Set up a staging environment

### 2. Installing and Configuring Better-Auth

```javascript
// Install Better-Auth
npm install better-auth

// Basic configuration
// pages/api/auth/[...auth].ts
import { createAuthHandler } from 'better-auth';

export default createAuthHandler({
  providers: [
    // Configure your providers
  ],
  callbacks: {
    // Define your custom callbacks
  }
});
```

### 3. Database Schema Generation

One of the most impressive features of Better-Auth was how the CLI tool automatically generated the necessary database schema. Running `npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate` created a comprehensive Drizzle ORM schema with tables for users, sessions, accounts, and verification tokens. The generated schema included thoughtful defaults like nanoid for API key generation, appropriate timestamp fields, and well-designed relationships between tables. Unlike Next-Auth where I had to manually set up and maintain database schemas, Better-Auth handled the entire database structure with proper foreign key constraints, unique indexes, and type safety. This alone saved hours of development time and eliminated potential security issues from improper database design.

### 4. Migrating User Data

One of the trickier aspects was ensuring user data remained consistent:

```javascript
// Example migration script
import { getUsers } from 'next-auth/admin';
import { migrateUsers } from 'better-auth/migration';

async function migrateUserData() {
  const nextAuthUsers = await getUsers();
  await migrateUsers(nextAuthUsers, {
    // Mapping configuration
  });
}
```

### 5. Updating Client-Side Code

```javascript
// Before (Next-Auth)
import { useSession, signIn, signOut } from 'next-auth/react';

// After (Better-Auth)
import { useAuth, login, logout } from 'better-auth/client';
```

### 6. Testing and Validation

I implemented a comprehensive testing strategy:

- Unit tests for auth-related components
- Integration tests for authentication flows
- User acceptance testing

## Benefits After Migration

After completing the migration, I immediately noticed several improvements:

1. **Performance**: Page load times decreased by ~15%
2. **Developer Experience**: More intuitive API and better documentation
3. **User Experience**: More seamless authentication flows with fewer redirects
4. **Customization**: Easier to implement custom authentication requirements

## Challenges Faced

The migration wasn't without difficulties:

- Dealing with session persistence differences
- Learning the new API and paradigms
- Ensuring backward compatibility during the transition
- Handling edge cases in user accounts

## Conclusion

Switching from Next-Auth to Better-Auth required upfront investment but has paid dividends in terms of application performance, developer productivity, and user experience. If you're feeling constrained by your current authentication solution, Better-Auth might be worth exploring.

Have you migrated between authentication providers? I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments below.
